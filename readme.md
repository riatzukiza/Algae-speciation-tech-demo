# Speciation

Speciation is a living, constantly changing, world. In speciation, the goal is to live on through your genes. You have a singular creature, and their goal is to survive, and reproduce, so that the species might live on another generation.

The game consists of many changing parts, the weather will be a factor in survival, too hot? too cold? your species must live on regardless. Over specialization will be your downfall.

More to come.
