# Speciation

Speciation is a project that I actively stream on [liveedu](https://www.liveedu.tv/foamy125/REdQq-speciation/).

Speciation is a game set in a living, constantly changing, world. In speciation, the goal is to live on through your genes. 
You have a singular creature, and their goal is to survive, and reproduce, so that the species might live on another generation.
The game consists of many changing parts, the weather will be a factor in survival, too hot? too cold? your species must live on regardless. Over specialization will be your downfall.


## QUICK START

```
git clone git@github.com:riatzukiza/Agae-speciation-tech-demo.git
cd Algae-speciation-tech-demo
npm install
npm run repl
```

I am looking towards getting this embeded in a browser soon, its written with electron so its not that hard to do.
Please let me know in a git issue if this doesn't work for you, and we can work through the problem together.

# Overview


It is (going to be) a multiplayer evolotionary combat arena, Where players will fight each other for the survival of their species.

Well, they don't nessisarily have to fight one another, cooperation is always an option. The goal is to exist as long as possible, though the conditions for existance here are different then one might usually encounter in these kinds of game.

First the basics of the game, you are a living entity with basic needs, 4 of them to be exact. Living things need nutriants, calories, vitamins, and water, more strictly speaking a living creature only needs calories, but with out the other 3 components, a living things caloric needs will grow beyond their ability to sate them, and die.

Calories provide energy nessisary to perform actions. Every action life can take will require calories. Nutrients provide the building blocks of your existance, they are nessisary to repair damage and to grow larger.

Before I go farther here, I have to explain a few things about calories and energy. When a creature burns calories, it does damage to its self. In the real world this means the production of free radicals, which if not contained will greatly shorten the life of an organism. While it is a valid strategy to just consume nutrients enough to replace that damage done, there is a limit to how much this can work, as for each action, energy is required, including repairing.

In Speciation, both water and vitamins (can) play a role in containing this damage. Water is the lubercant of life, organisims in speciation use less energy (burn fewer calories per action) if they have access to water. Vitamins (or antioxidents, I have not made up my mind on what to call these) reduce the amount of damage done when consuming calories.

Since all life needs these things, all life also has these things, so any life form represents a potential food source for other living things. Speciation does not have a solid distinguishment between plant and animal life.

Which brings us to the second big thing, mating.

Mate with anything you want, try for a rock if you want to, maybe you get lucky and you form some strange lichenesque type creature that is part rock. Obviously more similar things have a higher probability of success in these endevors, but theres nothing stopping an attempt to mate with a rock.
